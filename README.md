This is a simple user interface model built to present our idea-Myntra Flick at the Myntra Hackerramp.
This project is done using simple scripting languages and elements just to get an idea of the overall proposal.
We use HTML,CSS,Bootstrap for this front-end development and Figma to develop the prototype model.
